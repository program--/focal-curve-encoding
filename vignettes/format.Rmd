FCE is a simple encoding scheme with influences from the
[Tiny Well-known Binary](https://github.com/TWKB/Specification) specification.

## Concept

The general idea of this encoding format relies on the idea that as the number of subdivisions of a discrete uniform grid tend to infinity,
then the index mapping of a (pseudo) space-filling curve (SFC) to that grid will tend to points contained within the extent of that grid.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/process.png")
```

Then, this implies that we can project a 2-dimensional set of coordinates down to 1 dimension. In particular, our SFC mapping provides a
**1-dimensional (64-bit unsigned) integer** representation of **2-dimensional floating-point** coordinates. This representation is favorable in the case of
compression, as we can now take advantage of **variable integer (varint) encoding**, and we've reduced the amount of raw bits needed for storage
in approximately half.

Moreover, to further exploit the integer representation, if we provide an associative order, in the form of an array,
we can sort the integer coordinates and **delta encode** them before varint encoding.

While this approach is highly compressible and fairly fast, it comes with the tradeoffs that:

1. random access is not possible on the underlying data.

   > Random access *could* be possible, using offsets and lengths, but the cost of that negates the savings in projecting the original coordinates.
  
2. using too small of an _n_ results in a loss of precision.
